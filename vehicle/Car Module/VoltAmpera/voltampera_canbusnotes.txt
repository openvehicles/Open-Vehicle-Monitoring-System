CAN BUSES

http://www.evtools.info/ChevyVoltOBD2CAN.html

The Volt has 2 connectors (the standard one on the drivers' side, and an extra auxillary one on the passengers' side), with a total of 5 buses:

The Primary Powertrain Bus is easily accessible via inexpensive tools. It has been said that all data is gatewayed to the primary DLC,
and that the right-hand side was is really only useful for service programming of specific modules.

TX 7E4      8 06 2C FE 43 69 43 68 00   (input: config for voltage/current of charger)
RX 7EC      8 02 6C FE AA AA AA AA AA   (OK?)

TX 7E4      8 03 AA 04 FE 00 00 00 00   (input for display results)
RX 5EC      8 FE 43 70 00 00 00 00 00   (results, ~160 reads for a few seconds)

	ID=5EC	B2	Charging Current units 0.2 A (ex. 0x43 = 13.4 A)
		B3	Charging Voltage units 2 V (ex. 0x70 = 224 V)

Tachy writes: To request current and voltage of the charger and the outside temperature, you have to send the following sequence:
 
	7E4      8 10 08 2C FE 43 69 43 68 
	7E4      8 21 80 1F 00 00 00 00 00 
	7E4      8 03 AA 04 FE 00 00 00 00
 
The answer (160 times) is:
 
	5EC      8 FE xx yy zz 00 00 00 00
 
	xx = Charging Current, units 0.2 A (ex. 0x43 = 13.4 A)
	yy = Charging Voltage, units 2 V (ex. 0x70 = 224 V)
	zz = outside temperature, units 0,5°C, offset +40 ( ex. 0x60 => 8°C )

Explanatory notes by Burro:

  I have been watching this thread for a few days. I don't have a Volt but I do have extensive experience with automotive
  CAN bus applications and I think I can add some value to the discussion.

  According to the bus data presented above the DashDaq is using mode 0x2C to request the identifiers. The message
  structure for mode 0x2C for one, two and three parameters is as described above. Using that example, the ID 0x7E4
  is the battery module, 8 is the message length, 04 is the significant bytes in current message, 2C is the
  mode(dynamically defined data identifier), FE is the requested response ID and the next two bytes are the PID.

  The response is as follows: 0x7EC is the battery module response (0x7E4 + 0x08). This offset id response always holds
  true, that is why you see 0x7E8 as the response to a 0x7E0(engine controller) request. 8 is the message length again.
  6C is the affirmative response to the 2C request(0x2C + 0x40). This holds true for any mode request(mode 0x22 request
  should be affirmed with a 0x62 in the response). If you get a 7F in the response, this means there is an error with
  the mode request, either it isnt supported or there is a problem with the way the format was requested. FE is the
  response ID as requested in the previous message. You can request basically any ID between 00-FF. It is just a way
  for the tool to recognize which identifier(s) are being broadcast. The rest of the bytes in the response are just
  padding so that it is 8 bytes long.

  The next request is 0x7E4 again, letting the bus know you are asking for a response from the battery module. 8 is the
  message length. 03 is the significant bytes in the message. AA is read data by packet id, which is the ID you requested
  in the first message(FE). 04 is the next byte and that lets the module know you are looking for a fast response rate.
  Decreasing numbers here means decreasing response speed. 01 will get you one response and 00 will stop the response
  all together. The next byte in the message is FE and it lets you know you are getting the PIDs requested in that
  message as set up in the first message. The rest of the bytes are padding once again.

  Finally the response is 0x5E8. This is the ID assigned to the battery module for dynamically defined responses.
  It is 0x200 less than the standard response ID and should hold true for any module request. As an example, a request
  from 0x7E0 should generate a response from 0x7E8 unless you are asking for dynamically defined data in which case it
  will respond with 0x5E8(0x7E8-0X200). 8 is the message length. FE is the response ID you set up in the first message.
  2F is the data and rest is padding.

  This is a good way to reduce the clutter on the bus because you can request and receive multiple pids in one shot. As
  opposed to mode 22 which nets you one response per request. If you want to set up more than three you can just change
  the response ID from FE to one of the others like FD, FC, FB.... add your PIDs and then ask for the response. 

  A couple of quick notes. If you want to receive the messages for longer than about three seconds you will need to send
  the 0x101 message that was questioned in previous posts. This is the tester present message and it lets the module
  know you are still there and expecting a response. All of the generic OBD messages should work in this mode as well.
  The generic engine RPM ID is 0x0C(or 0x000C). In your original message if you specify this ID you should get engine
  RPM (make sure you ask 0x7E0 for this information). There are generic OBD Id's all over the net just use your favorite
  search engine. Finally, these PIDs may also work for mode 22 requests so those of you with a scangauge that are brave
  enough to still use it, should be able to code it in xgauge. Be cautious you don't clog up the CAN bus with too many requests though.

  Sorry for the long post, hopefully some of it makes sense.
