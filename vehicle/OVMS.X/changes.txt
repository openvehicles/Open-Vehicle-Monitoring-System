2012-09-02 1.3.1       Firmware 1.3.1
                       The following issues have been addressed (since 1.2.9):

                       Tidy-up for charge notifications
                       #57 Car: Motor temperature overflow
                       #58 Car: Strange range when low on power
                       #69 Wakeup temperature subsystem when car is woken up

2012-08-28 1.2.9       Preliminary firmware 1.2.9
                       1.2.9 - a (almost feature complete) release candidate for 1.3.1

                       This version is an (almost feature complete) release candidate
                       for 1.3.1. It addresses a few known bugs, but primarily works
                       on (a) adding support for v2 hardware, (b) improving recovery
                       from loss of GSM signal in poor cellular coverage areas, and
                       (c) changes to the alert notification mechanisms to try to catch
                       more 'charge stopped' type events.

                       The following issues have NOT been addressed, but should be
                       fixed in the final 1.3.1 firmware:
                         #57 Car: Motor temperature overflow
                         #58 Car: Strange range when low on power

                       The following issues have been specifically addressed:
                         #60 Car: Still getting some GSM unrecoverable issues
                         #61 Car: Acknowledge settings with detailed parameters
                         #64 Support for v2 base hardware
                         #65 Increase timeout in NET_STATE_NETINITP
                         #66 Increase modem reset timer to 2 secs
                         #67 Car: Raise charge interrupted alerts based on charge state (stopped vs done
                         #68 Give COPS a chance

                       Add homelink and charge timer support, plus misc fixes
                       Only send non-empty params to PARAMS? sms command
                       Remove need to RESET after can write change
                       Only NETINIT (not SOFTRESET) after a parameter change
                       Re-label parameters internally to match new user-friendly names
                       Re-work of sms command handlers to be table driven - saving 6% of flash
