// The OVMS_SOCALERT switch will enable a feature such that if the SOC falls
// below 5%, and the car is switched off (ie; not driving), the car will alert
// (by SMS and net PUSH msg) every twelve hours, until such time as the SOC
// recovers to at least 5%.
#define OVMS_SOCALERT

// The OVMS project started with support for v2.x Tesla Roadsters, and was
// then extended to support v1.5 Tesla Roadsters. Now, it is being extended
// to support other car types as well, with the first being the Volt/Ampera.
// So, we now have switches to control which car type is to be built. Only
// one of the following should be defined.
//#define OVMS_CAR_NONE
//#define OVMS_CAR_TESLAROADSTER
//#define OVMS_CAR_VOLTAMPERA
//#define OVMS_CAR_RENAULTTWIZY
//#define OVMS_CAR_OBDII
//#define OVMS_CAR_THINKCITY
//#define OVMS_CAR_NISSANLEAF
//#define OVMS_CAR_TAZZARI
//#define OVMS_CAR_MITSUBISHI
//#define OVMS_CAR_TRACK
//#define OVMS_CAR_KYBURZ

// August 2012 saw the introduction of a new hardware platform (v2), with
// support for SIM908 GPS, voltage sampling, a new processor, and a few other
// things. V1 uses PIC18F280+SIM900 and V2 uses PIC18F2685+SIM908.
// We now have a switch to control the build for V1 or V2 hardware platform.
//#define OVMS_HW_V1
//#define OVMS_HW_V2

// The DIAG code is a set of enhancement to support a DIAG mode on the
// serial port. It is primarily used for QC purposes, but also useful
// for advanced diagnostics.
// #define OVMS_DIAGMODULE

// The ACC code provides for advanced charge control - sophisticated charging
// algorithms.
// #define OVMS_ACCMODULE

// The OVMS_POLLER code supports OBDII polling for various vehicles. It should
// be enabled for those vehicles that require it.
// #define OVMS_POLLER

// The OVMS_BUILDCONFIG is a textual indication of the build configuration
// It should normally be defined in the build config itself
// #define OVMS_BUILDCONFIG
