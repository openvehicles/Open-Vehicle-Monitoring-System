Open Vehicle Monitoring System
==============================


The Server
==========

The server is a simple open source server which talks two protocols - one to the car and the other to
the cellphone App.

The car protocol is built on TCP using encrypted communication packets. See the documentation
directory on github for further details on the protocol itself.

The drupal server also includes a web interface for basic functions such as setting the password,
registering the car and checking status (see 'drupal' directory in github).

To deploy an OVMS server, you will need the ovms_server.pl script, the ovms_server.conf configuration
file suitably configured, the ovms_server.sql database tables in a mysql database, and optionally
the *.vece files (to convert error code to messages for different vehicle types).

The other scripts are purely for development and testing purposes.


Android Push Notifications
==========================

...are based on Google Cloud Messaging (GCM).

To be able to send push notifications to Android devices, you need to register a GCM project:

 - Log in to your Google account
 - Open https://developers.google.com/mobile/add
 - Select platform "Android"
 - Enter an arbitrary project name, e.g. "MyOvmsServer"
 - Package name should be "com.openvehicles.OVMS"
 - Activate "Cloud Messaging" and generate the key
 - Note the API key and project number (= GCM sender ID)

Enter the API key into your ovms_server.conf and the project number (GCM sender ID) into the
App vehicle configuration.
