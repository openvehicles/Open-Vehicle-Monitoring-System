Open Vehicle Monitoring System


The Server
==========

The server is a simple open source server which talks two protocols - one to the car and the other to
the cellphone App.

The car protocol is built on UDP using encrypted communication packets. Two passwords are used - one to
talk to the server and the other to talk to the App.

If the car module wants to send a message to the server, it uses the first password. Once the server
receives the message, it can decrypt and act on the instruction contained. Communications of this type
are used for network registration and PUSH notification messages to Apple/Android phones, or other alerts.

If the car module wants to send a message to the user, it uses the second password. The server has no
ability to decrypt such messages, so merely passes them on to the cellphone App transparently. The
cellphone App itself decrypts and acts on the message. In this way, as only the car module and cellphone
App have the password, the server has no way to spy/eavesdrop on these messages. Communications of this
type are used for such things as car GPS location updates.

The server also includes a web interface for basic functions such as setting the password, registering
the car and checking status.
