Open Vehicle Monitoring System


The clients
===========

The scripts "client_app.pl" and "cmd.pl" can be used to access the OVMS server from the command line.

Both will read "ovms_client.conf" for the server and login configuration. Change to your vehicle id,
server and module password.

"client_app.pl" will connect to the server, listen and output any protocol lines received forever
until stopped (Ctrl-C).

"cmd.pl" can be used to send single commands to the server/car. It will output only server responses
that match the command issued and terminate after having received no more command results for a
defined time.

"cmd.pl" can be used to query historical record entries from the server or to automate car communication.

Examples:

Query stored historical records:
	#> ./cmd.pl 31

Retrieve all records of type "*-OVM-DebugCrash":
	#> ./cmd.pl 32 "*-OVM-DebugCrash"

Send USSD code to query SIM account balance:
	#> ./cmd.pl 41 "*100#"
There's also the "querybalance.sh" script to do this.


Renault Twizy scripts
=====================

"rt_fetchdata.sh" will fetch all Twizy specific track telemetry records and save them using a
common filename prefix.

"rt_querylogs.sh" will query all SEVCON logs, i.e. ask the module to query them and send
the history records to the server.

"rt_fetchlogs.sh" can then be used to fetch all logs records from the server into local
files (similar to rt_fetchdata).

"rt_resetlogs.sh" will reset all SEVCON logs. Please note: not all log entries
may be clearable, query and fetch again to check the log contents after reset.
