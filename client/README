Open Vehicle Monitoring System
==============================


Perl modules
============

The following perl modules from CPAN are used by the clients:

  Config::IniFiles
  Digest::MD5
  Digest::HMAC
  Crypt::RC4::XS
  MIME::Base64

Install modules using cpanminus:
  cpanm Config::IniFiles Digest::MD5 Digest::HMAC Crypt::RC4::XS MIME::Base64


The clients
===========

The scripts "client_app.pl", "status.pl" and "cmd.pl" can be used to access the OVMS server from the
command line.

All will read "ovms_client.conf" for the server and login configuration. Change to your vehicle id,
server and module password.

"client_app.pl" will connect to the server, listen and output any protocol lines received forever
until stopped (Ctrl-C).

"status.pl" retrieves the last server stored record of a standard OVMS status protocol message.
You may specify the message type (letter) as an argument:

	S		State (SOC, charge state etc.) (Default)
	D		Environment (temperatures etc.)
	L		Location
	W		Tire pressures
	T		Update time
	F		Firmware version
	V		Firmware capabilities

See "OVMS protocol" documentation for record details.

"cmd.pl" can be used to send single commands to the server/car. It will output only server responses
that match the command issued and terminate after having received no more command results for a
defined time.

"cmd.pl" can be used to query historical record entries from the server or to automate car communication.

Examples:

Query stored historical records:
	#> ./cmd.pl 31

Retrieve all records of type "*-OVM-DebugCrash":
	#> ./cmd.pl 32 "*-OVM-DebugCrash"

Send USSD code to query SIM account balance:
	#> ./cmd.pl 41 "*100#"
There's also the "querybalance.sh" script to do this.


Push notifications & subscriptions
==================================

Use "notify.pl" to send a push notification alert text message to your Apps:

	#> ./notify.pl 'Hello World!'

If the server has mail notification support enabled you can use "subscribe.pl" to
manage your email subscriptions.

Subscribe:
	#> ./subscribe.pl joe joe@email.com
Unsubscribe:
	#> ./subscribe.pl joe -


Renault Twizy scripts
=====================

"rt_fetchdata.sh" will fetch all Twizy specific track telemetry records and save them using a
common filename prefix.

"rt_querylogs.sh" will query all SEVCON logs, i.e. ask the module to query them and send
the history records to the server.

"rt_fetchlogs.sh" can then be used to fetch all logs records from the server into local
files (similar to rt_fetchdata).

"rt_resetlogs.sh" will reset all SEVCON logs. Please note: not all log entries
may be clearable, query and fetch again to check the log contents after reset.
